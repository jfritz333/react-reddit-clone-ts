# Checkpoint

Convert Reddit...ish to React with Redux!

## Getting started

- Clone [this repo](https://github.com/gSchool/redux-unit-checkpoint) to your local machine
- Install the dependencies with either `yarn` or `npm install`
- This is styled with `Bootstrap v3.3.7`

Just like the previous checkpoints, you will be hitting the [provided API for this course](https://github.com/gSchool/collective-api) and be hitting the following endpoints:

- `http://localhost:8082/api/posts` (for the posts)
- `http://localhost:8082/api/comments` (for the comments)

You could roughly follow these steps (not necessarily in this order):

- Use yarn to add `redux react-redux redux-thunk`
- Create a reducer for each "resource", such as posts and comments, in this case
- Configure a store with `redux-thunk` and the reducers
- Create an actions / action-creators file for each "resource"
- Figure out which components should be connected components and implement `mapStateToProps` / `mapDispatchToProps` where necessary
